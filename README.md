#   Dev-Harry-Final-Project (Final Exam Schedule Generator) 
## Created By Noah Brown (CIS-376-01)
###  Purpose: To generate a schedule of upcoming final exams.
#### User Story: As a university of North Alabama student, I want to be able to know the time, name, date, and location of each of my final exams. 
##### So that, I can be ahead on preparing for my exams and do well. 
###### You can access the App via this Link [Here] (https://nbrown2002.github.io/Dev-Harry-Final-Project/) 

One of the most frusturating things can be organization. Many events can occur simultaneously and lead one to have no idea or notion of preparing ahead of time for them. 
This is more then apparent when preparing for final exams for the semester. It can be rather taxing as a student to prepare for all of these exams when you do not have a 
fully feldged schedule of when and where everything is. This is why I created this piece of software. It allows students to put in all of their information regarding their upcoming 
exams and then print out a schedule that puts everything in order from earliest to latest. The app currently allows for three exams to be processed by their date, title, time, and location
and sorts them out to avoid confusion. This way, everything will be organized completely to avoid confusion.
